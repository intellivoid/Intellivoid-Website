## Intellivoid Accounts
When you create an Intellivoid Account, you are required to give us a username and email. In
some cases our other services (or future services) may ask you additional information upon
registering such as your Name, Birth date and what country you are currently located in.
And if you already have an Intellivoid Account without this information already provided to us,
you will be asked for this information.

A password is also required but this is purely for authentication purposes to prevent
unauthorized users from accessing your Intellivoid Account.

By default, none of your information is shared publicly or with third-party services, your
Intellivoid Account is completely isolated **by default**. However, when you use services that
will display some information about your account publicly you will be asked if you agree
to this before proceeding. Information about your account will never be used for public
purposes without your consent. And we will never share your information with third parties
unless you agree to it.

The reason we need your email is purely for verification and contact purposes, in the case
we need to reach out to you or verify that you are the owner of the account.

Your username is also needed but it's mostly used as a way to identify a user's account,
it generally can be anything you want but we are not responsible if you choose to put
your address as your username.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Account Balances
Intellivoid Account's offer's a feature where you can add money to your Account for the
purpose of purchasing our products with ese, or maintaining paid subscriptions to our
services. You can view what's allowed and what's not allowed from our Terms of Service.

At the moment we only use PayPal as a form of payment processing, your PayPal account is
not linked to your Intellivoid Account. We have no way to automate this process or identify
your Intellivoid Account from your PayPal account, by default we use your PayPal's email
address (if available) as a way to find your Intellivoid Account, in that case the balance
will be added to your account after reviewing the transaction. If we cannot find your
Intellivoid Account after receiving payment, we will try to contact you to resolve this.
In the case if we cannot contact you, you must reach out to us by using our contact
form that's available on our main website otherwise after some time we will attempt
to refund you. More information can be found in our Terms of Service.
