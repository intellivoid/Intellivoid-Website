By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.

Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product requirements
(including age requirements) may apply. Additional terms will be available with the relevant
Services, and those additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you use those
Services.

Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access
them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide.
You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and
re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services
to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating
suspected misconduct.

Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in 
our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless 
you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do
not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, 
obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.

Our Services display some content that is not Ours (Intellivoid). This content is the sole
responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine
whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display
content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not
necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.

In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements,
administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those
communications.

Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a
way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.

## About these Terms

We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example,
reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly.

Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days
after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes
made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified
terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.

These terms control the relationship between Intellivoid and you. They do not create any
third party beneficiary rights.

If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t
mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).

If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
